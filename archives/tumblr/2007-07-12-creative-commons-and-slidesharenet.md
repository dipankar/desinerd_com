Checkout the Slideshare karaoke application built on top of the SlideShare API, a very cool tool which allows you to randomly pickup sideshows and have some really random fun ….

The API has been released some days back and hence the documentation is very sparse, but rest assured that with some more applications coming up there will be enough open source documentation around. This really cool piece of Javascript using the prototype library has been developed by Lalit patel , who is a specialist at JS and cross-browser issues. The code for this application has been released at google code under GNU/GPL … so you can just dive into the code eh ….

Enjoi the karaoking … and start thinking about the next big slideshare mashup eh ….
