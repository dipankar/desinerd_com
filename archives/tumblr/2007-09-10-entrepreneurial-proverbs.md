Some really interesting proverbs for the entrepreneur in all of us

“Cool ideas are useless without great needs”

“Start with nothing, and have nothing for as long as possible”

“For investors, the product is nothing”

“Great things are made by people who share a passion, not by those who have been talked into one”

Ahh goto run … a new bug to resolve and so much more to think about in my spare time :p
