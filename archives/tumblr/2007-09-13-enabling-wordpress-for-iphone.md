Awesome plugin to create a iphone compatible wordpress layout …. now my site can be viewed on an iphone without ay layout issues

from the plugin creators :-

“Feature List
Formats your blog content for optimized viewing on the iPhone.
	Automatically detects the iPhone’s Safari browser and only displays the custom theme to iPhone visitors, other visitors get your standard theme.
	Simple iPhone-like theme with common interface elements that compliments the iPhone’s internal applications.
	Images larger then 300 pixels wide are automatically scaled down to fit the iPhone optimized width.”
