Wierd title for a blog post :) , but its truly the start of the second phase in my rather short career. This week I have decided to move on from slideshare.net , to some other stuff. Lately I have started realizing how badly i needed to give time to my own ideas (and there are lots of them), with such short product life spans on the internet and the boom taking place interms of web valuations how can I possibly miss out on trying……

The internet is an awesome place to learn and create new things, to this end i must give a lot of credit to the last 8 months at slideshare.net where the team has done some pretty interesting stuff.  The systems team rocks, even if its pushed beyond its capacity ….. A big thanks is in order to my team mates (in random order)
Lalit …. JS guru
	Saurabh …. Systems guru
	Kapil …. best tech lead for sure
	Mayank …. c00l dev. and stock player :P
	Kaa …. creative creative n more
	Yats …. the zen master
	Golak …. “bhalo” dev.
	Abhishek(*) …. one of the most motivated guys ever
	Praveen(*) …. guilt free dev. guru :)
	Gaurav …. n00b domain sitter
	Mohit …. thinking and analytical dev.
	bhups …. abhi mile hai, aur kya likhoon

(*) these guys left slideshare coupla months back

Had a lot of fun, should not have missed out on the trips :( …. I am missing in nearly all the group photographs ….. time to photoshop some of the kodak moments he he. A big thanks to Amit Ranjan and the management team for giving me an opportunity to work with one of the best teams ever …. May the slideshare alexa rank keep on rising

Note:

Frequency of blogging will resume , as i just figured the problem of my upload speed was because of the MTU size (it needed to be 1492 on the WiFi router not 1500) …..  3 cheers to that  (AIRTEL BROADBAND)
