Now that i do *part-time* design work for my projects, i decided it was time to get all the free fonts available. As i am using ubuntu here are some awesome packages and links for fonts.

Packages : (command to install on ubuntu) 

sudo apt-get install ttf-gentium ttf-dustin ttf-georgewilliams ttf-sjfonts sun-java6-fonts ttf-larabie-deco ttf-larabie-straight ttf-larabie-uncommon

Another cool site:
