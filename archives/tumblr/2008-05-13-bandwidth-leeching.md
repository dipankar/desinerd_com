Lately desinerd.com has been under some tremendous bandwidth leeching from anonymous proxies. I am getting tired banning multiple IPs because they managed to eat up my monthly bandwidth quota in less than a week. Here are the public IPs which have hit me pretty hard

89.149.242.226
67.202.58.232
89.122.29.40
85.91.82.38
89.149.241.126
203.162.2.135

Time to use public IP ban lists, so that these leechers can’t attack me like this. All this has forced me to upgrade my setup and think a bit more about my content, so thanks to the guys who were using their brains so hard to pull my site down. Three cheers to IP blocking for now … hic hic hurrah
