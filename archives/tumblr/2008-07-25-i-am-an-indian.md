“I AM AN INDIAN, I AM A MUSLIM” - Omar Abdullah

We need more politicians like him, ready to say the right thing. Willing to make a choice for the nation first, then their religion. I can understand all the things we say about Kashmir, the truth is that in pure financial terms nation building is a costly exercise …. splitting into a separate state may look like the best but it will take tremendous amounts of help from its 2 warring neighbors.

I do hope we learn things and not make short-term stupid decisions that hurt our nations future. I don’t understand the nuclear deal properly, (there is so much in the fine print which we *commoners* never get to read) but faith is needed , mistakes will be made …. but its not easy to become a super-power

“sab kuch nahi chalega”
