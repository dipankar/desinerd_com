Httpfuse is a very simple concept which allows collaborative link aggregation. The strength lies in the fact that a significant part of the functionality is developed and it is well populated with data.  I have displayed one of the fuses i developed over at httpfuse, does it not look great. I have worked upon the data collection actually *well it has 4 million odd links* beat that :D. Its probably one of the very few Indian sites to have this amounts of data in its system to be honest. I know the founder, and he has done an amazing job â€¦. and continues to add more value to the simple concept of link aggregation.
