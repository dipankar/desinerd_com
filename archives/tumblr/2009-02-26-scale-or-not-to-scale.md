Well, for lack of better topics i will take this opportunity to talk about some cool things that i have started to learn namely the .NET platform. The best part is that i finally get exposed to complete GUI based tools to do nearly everything, (i am sure i will find a way to do most things on the commadline). Well new things and seems i need to scale than the applications i work on ;). More soon.
