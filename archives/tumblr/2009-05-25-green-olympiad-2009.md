Students need to enroll through their respective schools. The state, country and global winners are awarded exclusive prizes. Each and every participant also gets a certificate of participation from Ministry of Environment and Forests.

GREEN Olympiad also culminates into a 13 episode programme called the TERRAQUIZ which is televised every year. Top 32 schools across the globe participate in this multi episode quizzing
