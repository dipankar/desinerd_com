Today, i reached Hyderabad on a one day stay (well, i am out by tomorrow evening). The weather here is so f**king awesome that it had to be documented. For the last one week, I have been trying to locate cities where I can live without getting a heat stroke. Reaching Hyderabad today really made my day, now i have located a city which is not going to become a desert any time soon.

The traffic was relatively less and the trip from the airport to the place where I am staying was smooth to say the least. Staying in Delhi for the last 8 years, I have completely forgotten a life without the dust, heat and super traffic (beep beep). At 27 degrees, its the perfect climate post a very dry and hot summer for the whole nation. Till now the electricity and power has been good to me, which is making me very very happy.
Here are some graphs which measure some of the temperature and rainfall averages for both the cities over the year. Delhi is clearly becoming hotter and dryer. Will need to see if i can find some data to support that. Have fun, for all the stat minded people out there.
