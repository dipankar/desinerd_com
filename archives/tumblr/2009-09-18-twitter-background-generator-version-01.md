Working on a very basic twitter background generator, right now focusing on how to get the sidebar width right. It is very much under use at my twitter handle @dipankarsarkar (http://twitter.com/dipankarsarkar). The core idea is to be abe to communicate more information about what i do as a person using the background image. Some features that I personally want are
Transparency for the sidebar - The image underneath should be visible, right now its a grey opaque color.
	A right sidebar - After some research , I figured out that the safest and optimal width to cater for is 1200px, with the core content on the left sidebar though. More thoughts on that as I deploy some new changes.
	Better fonts - Although new fonts / languages can be deployed. The code is not flexible enough right now to add new fonts.

That is a long enough list for the day :), attaching the background with this as well. Let me know in case having cool backgrounds excite you.
