Now this Hockey world cup has one convert in me ! I saw what pakistan’s Sohail Abbas can do with his dragflicks … he is god when it comes to that skill. Taekema is as good, in the first Holland match it was fairly obvious why you need quality penalty corner players.

I am surely not like to be the one who defends when either of them is taking a potshot at the net. Mildly put, this is one skill that can make the game of hockey popular.
