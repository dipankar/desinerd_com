Well, chuck with his flashing is good fun â€¦ but his kung fu is not funny. I was okay with flashing about intelligence, but all this new flashing shit is irritating !

This episode revolved around the much in the background John Casey [good man blah blah] who at the end is relegated to civilian life [how tragic]. It finally goes into the machine he is, his patriotism and all that which we all already knew about. Throw in the mix the love of his life.

Still looking forward to Chuck becoming a full CIA operative ! :P
