Well the simplest way of solving this is to run

sudo apt-get install php5-gd 

That will install the necessary libraries that you need to keep continuing. If you are in windows then you need to go Â to your php.ini and uncomment the following lines

;extension=php_gd.dll
;extension=php_gd2.dll

[just remove the ; to uncomment them]

Hope that solves your image issues.
