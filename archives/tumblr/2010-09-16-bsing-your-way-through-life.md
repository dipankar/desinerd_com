One wonders how quickly time flies by ! Its pretty funny to realize that most of the times people are bull shitting other people [or worse, themselves]. The strength of the human mind seems to be its level of delusion, we all are fundamentally delusional. Some more than others.

One way of looking at it that you keep it all in check by anchoring your thoughts in reality. Well, the anchoring bit too is relative and a human at best. Some quotes to settle the imaginary debate

Affirmation without discipline is the beginning of delusion.Jim Rohn 

For me, it is far better to grasp the Universe as it really is than to persist in delusion, however satisfying and reassuring.Carl Sagan 

I have had to work long and hard to eradicate the dangerous delusion that, in a bad position, I could always, or nearly always, conjure up some unexpected combination to extricate me from my difficulties. Alexander Alekhine
