Just finished watching a fantastic Woody Allen movie “midnight in paris" , it is very clear that he still knows his shit! I was not expecting a lot from the movie, but ended up enjoying it with quite a few loud laughs thrown in. You had Owen Wilson, who was his usual calm self throughout and the rest really did a great job as well. The story line is about how people keep thinking the past was a better fit for them, and well it looks like people in the past also kept thinking the same.

Irrespective of the great depression and the many other wars, people in the past looked into their past with the assumption that the golden age has ended. Woody Allen takes this opportunity to make you see that the reality you exist is the golden age and must be made use in the best way possible. Its a good watch!
