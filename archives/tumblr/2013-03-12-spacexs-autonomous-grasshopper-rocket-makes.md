Show off ;) … great stuff @ SpaceX.
 

Musk’s visit to SXSW was his second stop in Texas. The entrepreneur spent time talking to lawmakers about developing a space launch facility in the Lone Star State. SpaceX currently has two launch facilities for its NASA missions and commercial satellite launch customers. The current mission to the ISS was launched from Cape Canaveral, Florida. SpaceX is putting the final touches on a facility at Vandenberg Air Force Base in California. Both sites are operated by the government, and SpaceXleases the launch pad.
