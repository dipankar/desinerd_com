I have the using the Geeksphone Keon over the last couple of weeks and its been an interesting experience till now. Just to start things of here is the unboxing of the packed unit. The box is really beautiful and really reminds you of a great mozilla experience!

The phone has fantastic battery life, for at least 3 days normal usage. The internet seems to be a little flaky, and the OS has crashed a couple of time though. Hope to put up more about firefox OS.
