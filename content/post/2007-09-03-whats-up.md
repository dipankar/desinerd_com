Just a reminder post on what all i am tackling this week :

1. Joomla extension development , its awesome fun . Will release something real useful soon.

2. pidgin(formerly known as gaim) development. I think i will join their patch submission group soon.

3. Fixing Net::POP3 on ruby … i think its kinda buggy …. lets see if i need to dive into some hacking to get it working for me …. :(

more randomness to follow …..

I think i need to finish the 3rd … really stuck up some stupid errors … that is forcing me to develop on my X2 at home .. need some RAD action ;) ….
