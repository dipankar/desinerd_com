I used to think that i am pretty smart when it comes to managing time, turns out it aint the case most times. At any given point of time , my management(or lack of it) ;) invariably leads to wierd complexities (which obviously cannot be disclosed). So here goes list of things i want done asap
Upgrade the wordpress, apparently the new admin GUI is uber-coool.
Change my current theme, because it sucks and i want to rebuild it using bluecss
Finish work on the projects i have started, coz they are blocking available bandwidth
Make http://kwippy.com bigger than anything in the micro-blogging space
Sleep a bit leeser (which never seems to happen)

On this lazy note, i choose to continue life and hopefully make something out of it. Please cut out the underlying philosophy in the post, it aint that deep after all.
