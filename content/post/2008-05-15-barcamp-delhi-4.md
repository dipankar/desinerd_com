For the uninitiated Barcamp is an unconference where all sorts of people come in for all sorts of reasons (freebies, free wifi included) . Those who are willing to present/speak on a topic simply add their names in the wiki and they are allocated a time slot to present. Though most attendees are related to software/internet the event is just not restricted to it, barcamp bangalore 6(BCB6) being the perfect example which had participation from all sorts of people from Internet Junkies to Social Activists.
