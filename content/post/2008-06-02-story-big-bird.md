(CNN) – Researchers have produced aerial photos of jungle dwellers who they say are among the few remaining peoples on Earth who have had no contact with the outside world.

A very random story on this picture, njoi

***********************************************************************************************

Vellan and Tipsy were sitting, happily looking at Bela their *ummm* hot wife, well this is one of the few surviving matriarchal societies (isolated from society, now you know why). If you do notice, there is a slight smirk on Bela’s face … thats is where the story starts.

Bela , Vellan, Tipsy the happy amazonian jungle family are young adults in their highly ‘consumer''ist economy. Spending some food to barter cool leafy summer wear is now-a-day very common, all the elders think this is crap but then societies evolve. Today is Bela’s birthday and the young guys want to impress her (after all an eventful night is at stake), there is a rumor that strange looking birds have been flying around … .so the bet between Vellan and Tipsy is to catch that bird. In all possibility we can say that this was one bet well beyond their reach, turns out Bela got Wimpy, their neighborhood food guy to take her out for the night. The so called researchers spoilt some amazonian’s wet dream …. nice guys finish last they say
