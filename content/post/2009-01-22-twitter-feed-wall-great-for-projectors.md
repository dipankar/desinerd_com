Inspired by http://twistori.com/. I wrote a generic tool which will allow people to setup a simple wall where people can post and it will automatically refresh. I built this tool specifically because it was needed at proto.in. I am very sure it will be useful to a lot of people out there.

Uses JQuery and a Queues for javascript library. Maybe someone can do some transition magic with it, i am still a javascript n00b :).

Here is the complete source code and demo. Please forgive the lack of documentation.
