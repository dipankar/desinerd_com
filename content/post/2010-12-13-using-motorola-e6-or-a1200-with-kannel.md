So for all the people who do not want to learn AT commands to get their old MotoRockr [aka motorola e6] and A1200 working with your kannel setup to send/receiveÂ MMS and SMS here is the kannel.conf and modems.conf.

The important part is the modems.conf which has the correct AT commands to receive SMSes.
