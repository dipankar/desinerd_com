Why why why would people keep buying expensive cameras and make sub-optimal use of them. The most common usecase photos I see of the not-talented do not need a $2000 camera. Is this the new guitar ? I do want numbers as to how many people get laid with cameras in there hands.

I have seen the really smart nerds with it, and the other ones as well. As offensive as it is, I do not understand the logic of this buy except for the wow factor. It has reached a point where I did need to write it out.

So note to myself, research on getting laid stats with expensive DSLRs in hand. Not that I would benefit from it :P.
