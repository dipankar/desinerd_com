There is this concept of a search plugin, something which most browsers have now-a-days (Post Mozilla .. Netscape Navigator) , look at the top right corner , right next to the URL bar. I had little idea how you created this so-called search plugin. After a bit of googling , I came across the following links:

1. Creating OpenSearch plugins for Firefox
2. Search plugins for firefox/IE7

The first site has this very nerdy approach of explaining how this opensearch plugin works, to keep it very simple its an XML file defining the following :
[xml]
Desinerd Search
Search Desinerd Search
desinerd search cool desi technology web20 web
-


— Image Data —-

UTF-8
false
[/xml]
Most of this is very simple to fill actually depending upon the search URl you have on your website.

To easily generate a search plugin for your website / blog / portal … just goto http://www.searchplugins.net and get an Opensearch XML generated. Its as simple as that. I created two .. one for http://www.slideshare.net and another for http://www.desinerd.com …. So you can check them out here …. You should check out first link to figure out how the search plugin can be auto-discovered from the above link …. You will notice that my site search plugin has been auto-discovered in your Firefox / IE 7 browser.

So why wait , get your site up on firefox/IE7 with a small piece of code eh :)

Although 156-215 is not that hard but people still avoid doing it when they are going for 1Y0-259. However a better way to go about this is attempting 1z0-042 before 220-602.
