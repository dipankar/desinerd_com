Here is some really cool stuff about google search. For a start let me introduce the concept of google subscribed link, think of it as an filter which allows you to share your content through the normal google search page. Its called a coop search because the user has to add this to his google search, if you send in bad content the user will stop using your specialized search . This was all the philosophy, now some code eh …

Example 1 : Desinerd hello
Code is here . Add it by clicking the button belowExample 2&3 : SlidesharePythonRuby API search
To do this I have this EvilRSS thing installed which outputs the Google site results as an RSS, what i feed is specific site data like rubydoc.org documentation for Ruby query and so on .
Code is here . Add it by clicking the button below



Example 4 : SlideShare tag search
Code is here . Add it by clicking the button below

You want one of your own … then jump along and read the next couple of links eh….

So join my subscribed links and use the following :

ss:
for searching on slideshare
tag:
for searching tags on slideshare
python:
for python API results on 
ruby:
for ruby API results on 
Desinerd
for getting a “banner” which is the hello world application
