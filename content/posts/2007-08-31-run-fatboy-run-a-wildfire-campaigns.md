This is about  new movie being released :Run Fatboy Run
“New British comedy hitting cinemas on 28 September 2007.

Overly lazy and commitment-phobic, Dennis (Simon Pegg) suffers a minor breakdown and ditches his pregnant girlfriend Libby (Thandie Newton) at the altar. Five years later, Dennis realizes just how big a mistake he made. But just as Dennis sets out with his young son to woo her back, he learns that a flashy new suitor (Hank Azaria) has claimed her heart. So, in order to win her back, Dennis decides to prove himself by training for his first marathon with over-sexed best friend (Dylan Moran) as his coach. In way over his head, Dennis’ pathetic attempt culminates in what may be the most spirited but hilarious race ever run.
