What progress have i made on the various things i have started to work on :

1. Something really cool that i have been working on with a really great partner of mine will be released soon. This is going to change how collaboration works across the internet :P.

2. The really cool slideshare upload features are done, next comes some really hard core stuff .. which i will definitely blog about so stay tuned…

3. The libpurple stuff was too much fun .. i think i will look at implementing XMPP file transfer for it … i really think that IM fie transfer kinda sucks in libpurple

4. bahh i cant think of anything more … i was though considering making a “widget.com” widget … only an iframe with crap filled in it he he … maybe later

more later …
