I did some work on my LinkedIn profile, fixed the information there. Updated stuff, so my new public professional profile is here. It looks very good and hopefully it will appear on google search as well.

As long as it does not beat “Dipankar Sarkar” for google search I am happy ;). Plus it seems with Dipankar in the profile I have a good chance of making it up in the “Dipankar” search. I wonder what kind of SEO the LinkedIn people have done.
