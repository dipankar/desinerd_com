So today i watched “Stardust” , a fantasy romance to keep it simple actually. Interesting watch … a 7 out of 10. 
Stardust : IMDB
So this last week i have been playing around with couple of really cool things. First of all i tried out e17 which i am loving right now .. and then i setup Samba(a windows network share) on QNX.
So i had an embedded board lying around, and this Thursday i was really frustrated with work … so i decided that i needed to setup the file server i long wished for. So i got the new version of QNX .. tinkered around and viola my own file sharing (40GB of it)… I do think that i should post pictures of it … that is when i have more time off ..
