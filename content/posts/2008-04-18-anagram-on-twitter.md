After a long struggle to write something interesting, i have finally released an uncut version of my twitter anagram bot. This bot can be found here at http://twitter.com/anagram101 . This took some homework initially, now i intend to make this bot healthier coz it seems to freak out with some encoding issue in the wordlist :D.

This is looking fun to use, so i really think you all guys out there will njoi it as well. Keep twittering and kwippying away to glory.
