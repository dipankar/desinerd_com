So congrats to the slieshare team who just got funding, three cheers to my mates there. So after a long wait they have finally found a match for their funding needs. Hopefully they will keep up the good work at http://slideshare.net.

In other news, i started using EC2 seriously and have found it to be an awesome service. My virtual machine was up for about 8 days before i finally pulled it down (bad choice it was as i ended up losing a lot of data). So this was a good exercise to learn from.

A lots of companies getting money now-a-days … wonder how many will come out on tops giving rich dividends to their investors. Time shall play all the moves out till then i shall keep quiet and keep chugging along …….
