I stood, to look over my fallen countrymen. It used to be all about the nation before i turned into stone, a mere statue to the stuff happening in our America today. We fought for what was right and ours … but our children today have forgotten those values.

It was the war for independence, I lead my army with the only possession that i really cared about …. my hand-made notebook. I promised to look over them till the end of time, all we needed to think about today was the nation to be born …. Howe, the British general was too busy fighting off his *british* enemy general Carleton, such were the British …. I knew we would make some early inroads …

It was a bright sunny Philadelphia morning …. we had planned our assault and our information said that the British were only twice as bigger. Should be easy, as the assault started i realized standing on the hilltop that we had been fooled … there were British troops all over the horizon much more in numbers than us. But we were in it, and fight we did …. very few survived … some remembered our fight to the death … in due time, America was born, and i was a statue looking over the graves of the thousands who fought for the *nation* besides me
