So here i post to introduce yet another short URL service  …. snipper.in

So i started this service for fun, built it in a record 3 hours he he … will open-source the code by the weekend. The service is dead simple  … you get a short url and you can view stats about how many click / last 5 IPs who clicked.

example:

http://www.kwippy.com/rane/kwips/2008/aug/05/121113/ has the short url  http://snipper.in/y

you can view the stats of the link at http://snipper.in/y/stats

API:

It has a simple rest based API http://snipper.in/geturl?url=[your url]

example: http://snipper.in/geturl?url=http://www.kwippy.com/dipankar

Well, i will add more features with time … till then njoi snipping :P
