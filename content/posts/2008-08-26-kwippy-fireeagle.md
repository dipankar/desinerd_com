Kwippy has fireeagle integration now :D …. and all done in 2 days flat. The API is not that stable to be honest, but has the potential for greatness.

The kwippy integration basically has a small signup application that is independent of the main app, there is a signup page which integrates and then the rest is in the parent application. I should be posting a picture here, but too lazy he he ….
