I am looking forward to attending proto @ blore, there are a lot of reasons to do so.
Great set of people, will get to meet the very best entrepreneurs in India. In addition, to understanding the challenges people are trying to solve.
	Shotgun Startup - amazing concept and i really want to be a part of it. The feeling of implementing something in a very short time is exhilarating to say the least.
	Product release - will also be the part of some cool products which will hopefully get showcased at proto. This is an awesome platform for people to show what they can do with code.
	Last but not the least a good place to learn things about technology, people and enterprises. A good mix of people in all phases of their careers.

I am very sure i left out some of the bigger reasons that we all want to be a part of proto :), feel free to state yours ….
