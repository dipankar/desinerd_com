I have been wondering how to write better things, and faster things. But more often than not I realize technology is nothing more than a tool to enable living things (like humans) perform more than their physical abilities (or extend the limitations).

The idea is to focus on the core ideas of human needs, which are fundamentally simple anyways. Not everything needs a google search and most of the Earth’s population seems to survive without it.

— End of wierd rant —

Yeah, i know that sounded real weird. I am thinking high technology, simple needs. Focusing on the right problem is probably an acquired ability based on prior experience.
