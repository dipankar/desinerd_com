It has been something that has been going on in my head for a significant amount of time and I believe that it is the right time for politicians and famous individuals to take their online reputation management as seriously as the offline one. Here, i will outline a very basic strategy that i believe will equip celebrities and politicians to strengthen their brands.
So lets start with some assumptions that will make our lives easier as the post goes on. 
Paid advertising stand-alone is not an effective way of reaching out.
A holistic or integrated approach towards internet marketing is what will allow long-term gains.
Like most blog posts, this is highly subjective. Feel free to improve, argue, debate any points.


So with this initial setup we can charge into how a politician X can become an online brand. 

Goals
To plan for the next coming elections, which means that it has to be a sustained campaign over the next 2-3 years to make a meaningful impact. 

It also has to ensure that he remains at a peak during his election times, and is able to sustain public interaction at a locality level.

Mechanisms available
We all seem to assume that social media, by default is the internet. In a country with nearly 430 million wireless connections, a strategy also needs to address the offline, but mobile populace.
 So here is a list of potential ways of reaching the user using social media
Internet - Blogs / content
Mobile (SMS, MMS or GPRS)
Internet - Social networks
and many more …

The list can go on, but it is all dependant on the target audience which may be some remote district in West Bengal (India). 
Why ? Why not ? 
“One does not fit all”, and that is the reality. I would love to use social media to create and enhance everybody’s reputation. For an example, an MLA from a remote bihar village has no use for social media in his political career (unless of course he has national / state level ambitions).
Cosmopolitan cities like kolkata, Delhi, Mumbai, Chennai, Bangalore have all shown that the internet may emerge as a potentially important mechanism for party propaganda as well as reputation management.

So if you guys want to have a chat with me discussing this further, do comment or email me at me@dipankar.name.
