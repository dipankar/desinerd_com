I have been using the Samsung i9103 for quite a while and have tried out most of the available experimental ROM out there. Most of today was spent trying to find out the right combination to make the phone usable again. Here are the steps to having a really good setup on this phone

ROM : http://hotfile.com/dl/145780524/f7d1f45/I9003XXKPE.zip.html

2. Now you need to root the device and can use the following guide and image to do the same. It worked out pretty well for me.

3. Open the Tweaks application and apply the various optimizations. In addition to that install AWD launcher! Its an absolutely phenomenal launcher imho,

Other tuneups you can do are

Shift to Ext4, read the post below on XDA developers.
