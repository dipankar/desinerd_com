      <title>Going from WordPress multisite to regular wordpress</title>

      <description>We had a wordpress multi-site installation that was working just fine! However custom domain and SSL pose a clear problem, along with any specific changes one might have to make to the installation.
NO CODE! NO SQL!
So I decided to move back to regular wordpress. Now we are using the popular exponent theme, the challenge is that we are using a default demo setup which is modified. The goal was to make an easy shift, not make it into a week long project ;).</description>

      <description>The default guide for Huginn installation works pretty well. The only part where you do get stuck is
sudo bundle exec rake production:export So what really happens is that the console looks like it stuck, which is quite frustrating. Lets say you force quit this (Crtl^C). Try running it again and you will get an error like.
root@localhost:/home/huginn/huginn# sudo bundle exec rake production:export --trace ** Invoke production:export (first_time) ** Invoke production:check (first_time) ** Execute production:check ** Execute production:export ** Execute production:stop Stopping huginn .</description>

      <description>Show off ;) … great stuff @ SpaceX. Musk’s visit to SXSW was his second stop in Texas. The entrepreneur spent time talking to lawmakers about developing a space launch facility in the Lone Star State. SpaceX currently has two launch facilities for its NASA missions and commercial satellite launch customers. The current mission to the ISS was launched from Cape Canaveral, Florida. SpaceX is putting the final touches on a facility at Vandenberg Air Force Base in California.</description>

      <description>Reid Hoffman started his professional life with the intention of becoming an academic.
But then he realized: “in order to be a professional scholar, you have to dedicate a vast majority of your career to writing esoteric books that only 50 people will understand.” So instead, he got into the technology industry with a job at Apple, where he helped build eWorld, Apple’s version of America Online. Next, he started a company called SocialNet.</description>

      <guid>https://www.desinerd.com/posts/rfc-6455-the-websocket-protocol/</guid>
      <description>The WebSocket Protocol enables two-way communication between a client running untrusted code in a controlled environment to a remote host that has opted-in to communications from that code. The security model used for this is the origin-based security model commonly used by web browsers. The protocol consists of an opening handshake followed by basic message framing, layered over TCP. The goal of this technology is to provide a mechanism for browser-based applications that need two-way communication with servers that does not rely on opening multiple HTTP connections (e.</description>

      <description>My greatest fear as a startup founder isn’t to fail, it is to become a zombie startup. Kind of like in the 6th Sense when Bruce Willis doesn’t realize he is dead and tries to have a nice dinner with his wife, there are startups out there who are still “operating” but might as well not be.

      <description>One of the first things that i wanted to implement in my university [~2006] was a operating system with only the Firefox browser as the core application. Turns out that is a popular reality now with the Chromebook and well to some extent the Firefox OS which is being released. I at that point had no idea that mobile would become that big, with the exposure that I had. Its all coming together!</description>

      <description>Well not a marketing post, I recently bought KAV or Kaspersky anti-virus for all the windows machines that I run. Lately it has become extremely bloated and well it brought all my machines down to their knees. The goal of running lean and mean, while giving me optimal online protection seems to be lost on them.
Being the engineer that I am, my response was to find out the leanest one around [for free].</description>

      <description>Mine is a dual connection household, I use one Airtel connection as the primary and the secondary MTNL one for backup. However, it seems I will need to change the order of those soon. Lately, airtel seems to have very odd bandwidth counters which always seem to never match up with my router connection monthly counters. The difference is more than 20-30% month on month [adding both up and down counters!</description>

      <description>Here are the ways you can export tables and databases, each of them have their advantages and disadvantages depending on the task at hand. We will list out each with examples and discuss them.
We will assume that the database name is D and table name is T.
Going native with SQL and generating an csv from the MySQL console Assuming that you are already logged into your mysql console using say mysql -u -p replace with your username replace with your database You can use the following command to generate an csv of pretty much any SQL.</description>

      <description>I encountered some interesting issues when pulling out CSV from my MySQL databases. The core issue was the csv generated was not seemingly compatible with the various spreadsheet readers in Windows. After having a closer look at the file, it turns out to be an encoding issue clearly.
As the database was Latin1 encoded, the carriage return was handled as r [shows up as ^M on VI] in some text blobs.</description>

      <description>One of my recent experiments with myself has lead me to the conclusion that actual objective work done is not as important as perception management. On the contrary, people who do perception management get some work done sometimes. This recent run had enough data points for me to validate my own skills, but taught me that work has no co-relation with the final perceived result.

      <description>Just finished watching a fantastic Woody Allen movie “midnight in paris&amp;quot; , it is very clear that he still knows his shit! I was not expecting a lot from the movie, but ended up enjoying it with quite a few loud laughs thrown in. You had Owen Wilson, who was his usual calm self throughout and the rest really did a great job as well. The story line is about how people keep thinking the past was a better fit for them, and well it looks like people in the past also kept thinking the same.</description>

This setup uses redis, memcached, and mako as the templating language. Lets assume the application name is project.
project/project/main.py - This is the core application file that loads up bottle and the pluginsproject/INSTALL - This is the readme and simple installation instructionsproject/middlewares.</description>

      <description>There has been so much talk about ecommerce in India, how it is going to revolutionize the way Indians buy/sell stuff. From all the data available it clear that no breakthrough is in sight for any of the models implemented in the market. We can have a look at the classifieds model, which seems to be broken through and through for the India market. We Indians do not like to sell our used stuff, and well do not want to buy it as well.</description>

I recently encountered the Citrix XenCenter in production and am convinced it is the right move to use commandline only, though it is not for the windows administrators ;) [atleast the ones who do not know what is the powershell].</description>

      <description>For all the people who have been following the haiku project, it is truly playing out as a viable alternative to the desktop wars with Linux. In my opinion there were only a few that could have beaten the windows dominance, one was the photonGUI and then the BeOS. Turns out the Mac has won a huge chunk of the market, while BBM is killing the photonGUI slowly but steadily.</description>

I do hope we understand the point of sticking it out together as a nation, and possibly be one of the greatest ever in this phase of human civilization.</description>

      <description>Well, had to setup some stuff on dreamhost. Turns out that they are fairly bad on django hosting. Here is a working passenger_wsgi.py that is possibly much better than the default. Please not that you must have paste [http://pythonpaste.org/] installed for this to work correctly.
This has python2.7 locally installed in your account, with all the libraries locally. Dreamhost is quite painful, as the documentation is incomplete clearly!</description>

      <description>Guys after a long break, I have come out of my slumber to talk about my first publication with Packt publishing. In short the book is about tips and tricks around the upcoming Nginx web server. You can check it out using this link. This has been published by Packt publishing, a UK based technical publishing house.
It would not have been possible without the tremendous support of the people around me, and in specific the many people I have worked with.</description>

      <description>Why why why would people keep buying expensive cameras and make sub-optimal use of them. The most common usecase photos I see of the not-talented do not need a $2000 camera. Is this the new guitar ? I do want numbers as to how many people get laid with cameras in there hands.
I have seen the really smart nerds with it, and the other ones as well. As offensive as it is, I do not understand the logic of this buy except for the wow factor.</description>

      <description>We all think about what we want, not what we need to do most of the times.
We ask about what we want, because its easier to figure it out without the complex web of relationships that surround us.
We choose to loose data[i.e not consider possibilities] to solve a very hard problem in the shortest time possible.
It invariable puts us in control of our world, and in ways of lesser control of the world outside.</description>

      <description>So for all the people who do not want to learn AT commands to get their old MotoRockr [aka motorola e6] and A1200 working with your kannel setup to send/receive MMS and SMS here is the kannel.conf and modems.conf.
The important part is the modems.conf which has the correct AT commands to receive SMSes.

      <description>One wonders how quickly time flies by ! Its pretty funny to realize that most of the times people are bull shitting other people [or worse, themselves]. The strength of the human mind seems to be its level of delusion, we all are fundamentally delusional. Some more than others.
One way of looking at it that you keep it all in check by anchoring your thoughts in reality. Well, the anchoring bit too is relative and a human at best.</description>

      <description>One wonders what happened to the stories we used to hear about space wars and “Star wars” and so on. Recently, the IAF retired its only super high altitude flying machines capable of shooting down lower orbit spy satellites ! Are we all coming to a close end with respect to space warfare. I think that the paradigm has shifted drastically, and some research into new age technologies [plus, geo-political and financial dynamics].</description>

      <description>One frustrating movie after the other, Bollywood intends to kill me ! The flavor of the season seems to be satires, especially political ones. After watching some mythology based stuff in Rajneeti, one has to deal with this other end of the spectrum. Its all good, and giving valuable exposure to the plight of our fellow citizens, the actual drivers of our still agrarian driven economy. What is disappointing is that it shows what exists, but not how to go about resolving it.</description>

      <description>Well, I was thinking today the whole world is suddenly all about touch screens ! Just like all other devices, I am sure it has some effect on humans. I started doing some research as to the published papers on this topic, turns out that there are none. So here is my take on what can be the potential issues with touchscreens ergonomic issues, it can lead to issues with your finger with longer term use of such devices.</description>

I was using the trunk as it has goodies [like a blog] which the stable did not have.</description>

      <description>Well this is a post about something very common, the gel pen. Yesterday, i bought yet another one of them and i should say that my affair with them continues. It all goes back to school, at least in India when i started writing with an “adult” pen it was a messy ink pen, definitely something that would not lend itself to rough handling. Then the discovery of new lands in the form of the ball pen happened, in around 1997 there was a whole range of cool new pen which arrived one of them was the Mitsubishi ball point, one fine pen it was [still is].</description>

      <guid>https://www.desinerd.com/posts/gd-library-error-imagecreatetruecolor-does-not-exist/</guid>
      <description>Well the simplest way of solving this is to run
sudo apt-get install php5-gd
That will install the necessary libraries that you need to keep continuing. If you are in windows then you need to go to your php.ini and uncomment the following lines
;extension=php_gd.dll ;extension=php_gd2.dll
[just remove the ; to uncomment them]
Hope that solves your image issues.</description>

It has a semaphore which blocks the cron running, in my case the PHP script ran for too long and ate up too much memory. I needed to modify my php.ini to ensure that it could take up more memory.
Another issue was that you needed to delete a certain variable in the Drupal database, use the following for a quick resolution to the problem.</description>

      <description>So here is a quick snapshot at how to get all your wordpress blogposts using python [or wordpresslib to be specific]
– #!/usr/bin/env python import wordpresslib import tinyurl wordpress = raw_input(&amp;lsquo;&amp;lsquo;Wordpress URL:&amp;rsquo;&amp;rsquo;) user = raw_input(&amp;lsquo;&amp;lsquo;Username:&amp;rsquo;&amp;rsquo;) password = raw_input(&amp;lsquo;&amp;lsquo;Password:&amp;rsquo;&amp;rsquo;)
prepare client object wp = wordpresslib.WordPressClient(wordpress, user, password)
select blog id wp.selectBlog(0) posts = wp.getRecentPosts(100) for p in posts: if p.title.find(&amp;ldquo;p=&amp;rdquo;)&amp;lt;0: print p.title,&amp;quot; - &amp;ldquo;,tinyurl.create_one(p.link) – Now that is real easy to use IMHO, i just started using this in one of my scripts.</description>

Nick Wirth is a rockstar who will define CFD to be the game changer in F1 for sure. I am a big supporter of such changes which can potentially make F1 budgets much lesser and who know maybe we can have the entry of much smaller teams in the future.</description>

The interviews were exceptional and there were numbers which really gives someone like me something to objectively thinking about.</description>

Are 1s and 0s, gendered !
Technology, if we look at only digital technology would count as one of crucial blocks of enabling all [of all colors, of all sizes] to take a pot shot at being successful [in various degrees]. It is hilarious to see how old school individuals who run our country want to empower every class by giving them subsidies [jobs, ration] and not fostering an environment where all can achieve self respect by working towards individual goals.</description>

      <description>Just watched Road the movie at PVR priya ! For one i am a fan of weekday movie watching … Much better the crowd is less and i can hear everything real loud and clear.
It turns out that this movie with all its “starbucks” lines is clearly meant to be an art movie of the US and European audiences. It is highly improbable that a kid in middle of Rajisthan is talking about this particular brand and over it actually moves on that easily from his current dhaba employer.</description>

      <description>Well, working on freeBSD right now some immediate learnings for most linux users Ports is as good as apt-get [and i would say much better, when i started installing stuff] You will need to start with installing vim and bash to make your life a lot easier
So the target was to install python and nginx, both of which are very easy to install once you understand how the whole ports collection system works.</description>

      <description>Now this Hockey world cup has one convert in me ! I saw what pakistan’s Sohail Abbas can do with his dragflicks … he is god when it comes to that skill. Taekema is as good, in the first Holland match it was fairly obvious why you need quality penalty corner players.
I am surely not like to be the one who defends when either of them is taking a potshot at the net.</description>

      <description>So i watched this interesting hindi movie today Karthik calling karthik, which should also be be called the watered down Indian version of the cult book &amp;amp; movie ‘Fight club’. [Stop here if you don’t want to know what the movie is]
Unlike say fight club where i would say that the plot was beyond most of us ! This movie tries to explain itself too much and loses out on what could have been too easily.</description>

      <description>I realise that i am an extremely obsessive person ! So i ended up following formula 1 [the drama that it has become] over the last 2 months. A small recap for the uninitiated End of last season saw the exit of many engine manufacturers namely Toyota, BMW, &amp;amp; nearly Renault. So the engines on the grid are Ferrari, Mercedes, Cosworth[due to the new teams] &amp;amp; Renault. It would count as a huge loss, as most of the engines have very similar specs, though certain other things like reliability &amp;amp; fuel consumption are still going to be the game changers.</description>

      <description>Been watching skins for quite some time and i must admit that this current season is a let down from before ! Even the fat segal’s inital tune is all mumbled up, not that cool anymore. Some very easy reasons as to why this is not working for me Most of the episodes are very very disconnected, the notion of time that was so seamless in the earlier 3 seasons is completely missing.</description>

As a rather naive spectator to the global policy game, here are some conclusions that I have based my current statement on. Being rather country-locked, and especially nations that are in a constant state of political flux. We are in a tremendous disadvantage, unable to appease them or take control of them.</description>

After spending a lot of time thinking about how to handle 100 million entries , concurrency and a lot of jazz here are some conclusions that I have reached. Tokyo Tyrant needs some testing personally. Can it work well within a constrained VPS ? I doubt that after reading all the test results. So need to do a benchmark for this.</description>

Here, i will outline a very basic strategy that i believe will equip celebrities and politicians to strengthen their brands. So lets start with some assumptions that will make our lives easier as the post goes on.</description>

The idea was to use it to cache certain objects in a system. JMS - Seems to be an integral part of my J2EE learning, this is what often defines performance in an application. Especially when good high speed JMS library implementation cost big money.</description>

      <description>On the 15th, I landed at the new IGI terminal from Hyderabad at about 12.10. Hyderabad was a good experience, but most importantly i realized the most striking things about Delhi as soon as I landed.
The Delhi IGI airport is truly international now (at least by the looks of it), swank restaurants, shops and more. The saddest part is that the people have failed to change their attitude. This is reflected in the what happened when i went to the pre-paid taxi booth (manned by the Delhi police)</description>

      <description>I have been wondering how to write better things, and faster things. But more often than not I realize technology is nothing more than a tool to enable living things (like humans) perform more than their physical abilities (or extend the limitations).
The idea is to focus on the core ideas of human needs, which are fundamentally simple anyways. Not everything needs a google search and most of the Earth’s population seems to survive without it.</description>

Some basic observations are Not everyone can program or should program - Conceptually it is really easy to type in read a tutorial or 2. But what i saw is pure torture for a guy like me , you need some talent to write a decent application.</description>

      <description>Well due to one of my best friends i have got rather addicted to GITS :) or “The ghost in the shell”, an awesome japanese anime series. There is a concept or rather a case of the laughing man, and the basis for that is a JD Salinger short story of the same name. I take this post to link up to that story, hope you all have a great week ahead.</description>

      <description>Very interesting article, and something that has appeared as a reference in “The ghost in the shell”. Allow me to begin these considerations on the uncertainties of Europe’s political identity at the beginning of the 21st century by referring to celebrated formulations from another European writer who, although belonging to a previous generation and writing along quite different lines, nevertheless shared some of the same experiences, namely exile and antifascist intellectual commitment: I am thinking of Thomas Mann.</description>

      <description>Tejas crosses a milestone
Ravi Sharma
BANGALORE: In a milestone, a Light Combat Aircraft (LCA) Tejas took off from here and for the first time dropped live stores (bombs) at a firing range.
The dropping of two 25-pounder bombs, with one striking the target and the other falling within the inner 25 yard circle, was undertaken by Prototype Vehicle-3 of the LCA programme.
The successful dropping of the light, marker bombs will enable the Aeronautical Development Agency (ADA) – designers of the fly-by-wire LCA – to not only prove the working of the aircraft’s flight control software for weapon drops and aiming, but also take forward the LCA’s weaponisation programme.</description>

      <description>Proto has been taking place for sometime, but Jan 2009 is my first proto.in attendance and it was worth the trip to Bangalore. I went in with some expectations and yes, they were fulfilled. The highlights of the event is given below. Awesome talks - There was one talk by Bob Young(founder of redhat) which was simply awesome. There were others as well which were informative and fun sessions. Great audience - People from all walks of professional life, met a lawyer, a HR guy, a finance guy and so on … with so much variety one can only choose to get bored of such company.</description>

      <description>Inspired by http://twistori.com/. I wrote a generic tool which will allow people to setup a simple wall where people can post and it will automatically refresh. I built this tool specifically because it was needed at proto.in. I am very sure it will be useful to a lot of people out there.
Uses JQuery and a Queues for javascript library. Maybe someone can do some transition magic with it, i am still a javascript n00b :).</description>

      <description>I know it would be simple for a lot of people reading this blog :). But the easiest way to remote desktop into a windows machine using a X based linux distro is to install rdesktop.
http://www.rdesktop.org
For ubuntu and debian based distro, fire up the console and type
sudo apt-get install rdesktop
This would install the client.
rdesktop &amp;lt;server IP/domain&amp;gt;
This would fire up the windows remote desktop stuff.</description>

      <description>Today was a good day as i learned some valuable lessons about django and nginx. ALWAYS close the database cursor in django, it can lead to some pretty wierd memory issues going forward. FIND the most optimal number of database connections you initialize for you connection pooling. This will let you optimize on memory going forward. ENSURE that you do not set a very high client_timeout, this means that if connections are not explicitly not closed by the client then the web server will not timeout.</description>

What stories they hide within their seemingly mundane meanings. The most influential philosophy in America in the first quarter of the twentieth century. Viewed against the widely diversified intellectual currents that have characterized American life, pragmatism stands out as an energetically evolved philosophical movement.</description>

Whatever it is, this is a time to build it and ride the wave with the support of the entire startup community.</description>

Mumbai attacks - India hardens as a state, we have a new look in our diplomacy. We want action and not reactions from our under-performing politicians. J&amp;amp;K elections - Another great event for our democracy. Finally, a new young CM who can make a difference if he chooses to.</description>

So keeping in mind that you want to move on from pownce, try something new … or just try kwippy.</description>

In this process I have see yet another intelligence lapse where probably 200+ people will lose their life on the final count and this will create a dent in our national image. England conveniently goes back home after not even coming close to winning their matches in cricket, a whole host of articles being published about how India will lose its “terror free” south Asia image, and finally how it affects the Delhi elections coming up.</description>

      <description>To be honest, I am a very conspiracy theory kind of a guy. Always believe things after i can validate certain things personally, that invariably leads to me getting too involved (call it the observer effect). But then again there are certain things that are much bigger than me which i believe are absolute frauds, i will state some of the most obvious ones. Humans landing on the moon (yeah right, NASA is struggling now … wonder why they need to design what already works) NGOs are for the greater good (from what i hear they are only for their own good, time we stopped using the tax payers money for them) Net neutrality (impossible, DNS servers still in the USA … the point is lost on me as to how is it fair, internet as we know is still very much controlled by americans) United Nations / World Bank are global organizations (now that is just BS, if we see the UN with its veto powers ….</description>

      <guid>https://www.desinerd.com/posts/codeigniter-nginx-facebook-application/</guid>
      <description>This is a basic tutorial on how to get CodeIgniter facebook application on nginx (with the gotchas). The nginx configuration would be like the following
server { listen 80; server_name blah.com; location ~ /index.php/ { root /home/production/blah; index index.html index.htm index.php; include conf/fcgi.conf; fastcgi_param SCRIPT_FILENAME /home/production/fb_apps/quickdate/index.php; fastcgi_pass 127.0.0.1:9000; } access_log /usr/local/nginx/logs/blah.access_log; error_log /usr/local/nginx/logs/blah.error_log; }
The critical line is the fastcgi_params parameter, that changes the whole game. In the code Igniter application you need to add the following file in [app]/system/application/libraries/FB_controller.</description>

      <description>In my experience with both rails and django, i would have to admit that a lot of things need to be improved at the core of these platforms so that developers can truly deploy a really fast production site. Let talk about what we did at kwippy to make it that much more faster than the default Django setup. Use memcached properly : The trick in getting speed is to cache all logged out pages and heavy caching of the user objects when logged in.</description>

      <description>When you are using a platform like django you realise how slow sessions can get when you are using the database as a backend. The problem of using a memory cache like memcached is the fact that when you restart the server to refresh the cache or remove stale objects, the problem is that you lose your sessions data and a lot of people using your site get logged out. The only solution to this problem is to use 2 memcached instances , one for your regular python objects and another for your sessions objects … this is not a default feature in Django.</description>

      <description>“Life’s fair if you don’t compare”
The basis of article is the above quote which has no known author. Yesterday, i was sitting with my friends and i was the only IITian sitting there. When these guys started talking about their university life, well I started to realize that the golden years of fun for them were the toughest years for me and my batch. To start this all out, lets go back to the end of 12th and then college life.</description>

      <title>Django : using HTTP authentication for your views</title>
      <link>https://www.desinerd.com/posts/django-using-http-authentication-for-your-views/</link>

      <guid>https://www.desinerd.com/posts/django-using-http-authentication-for-your-views/</guid>
      <description>This is a small tutorial on how to use HTTP authentication for your site. Firstly you need to copy this file to httpauth.py and place it at /httpauth.py
import base64 from django.contrib.auth.models import User from django.http import HttpResponse from django.contrib.auth import authenticate, login
#############################################################################
def view_or_basicauth(view, request, test_func, realm = &amp;ldquo;&amp;rdquo;, *args, **kwargs): &amp;quot;&amp;quot;&amp;quot; This is a helper function used by both &amp;lsquo;&amp;rsquo;logged_in_or_basicauth&amp;rsquo;&amp;rsquo; and &amp;lsquo;&amp;lsquo;has_perm_or_basicauth&amp;rsquo;&amp;rsquo; that does the nitty of determining if they are already logged in or if they have provided proper http-authorization and returning the view if all goes well, otherwise responding with a 401.</description>

      <title>httpfuse : best way to aggregate links</title>

      <guid>https://www.desinerd.com/posts/httpfuse-best-way-to-aggregate-links/</guid>
      <description>Httpfuse is a very simple concept which allows collaborative link aggregation. The strength lies in the fact that a significant part of the functionality is developed and it is well populated with data. I have displayed one of the fuses i developed over at httpfuse, does it not look great. I have worked upon the data collection actually well it has 4 million odd links beat that :D. Its probably one of the very few Indian sites to have this amounts of data in its system to be honest.</description>

The kwippy integration basically has a small signup application that is independent of the main app, there is a signup page which integrates and then the rest is in the parent application. I should be posting a picture here, but too lazy he he ….</description>

So i started this service for fun, built it in a record 3 hours he he … will open-source the code by the weekend. The service is dead simple … you get a short url and you can view stats about how many click / last 5 IPs who clicked.
example:

We need more politicians like him, ready to say the right thing. Willing to make a choice for the nation first, then their religion. I can understand all the things we say about Kashmir, the truth is that in pure financial terms nation building is a costly exercise …. splitting into a separate state may look like the best but it will take tremendous amounts of help from its 2 warring neighbors.</description>

      <description>I stood, to look over my fallen countrymen. It used to be all about the nation before i turned into stone, a mere statue to the stuff happening in our America today. We fought for what was right and ours … but our children today have forgotten those values.
It was the war for independence, I lead my army with the only possession that i really cared about …. my hand-made notebook.</description>

Today i participated in ILUG-Delhi’s workshop, it was interesting to the end that i figured out how important it is to break down information into chewy bits. I was supposed to give a presentation on “building social networking applications using python”, i made the wrong assumption about the people present there.
But then one has to learn the hard way to do better the next time. I do look forward to taking part in more such events, ILUG-Delhi does require some more technical talks though tad bit more basic to start off with.</description>

(CNN) – Researchers have produced aerial photos of jungle dwellers who they say are among the few remaining peoples on Earth who have had no contact with the outside world.
A very random story on this picture, njoi
Vellan and Tipsy were sitting, happily looking at Bela their ummm hot wife, well this is one of the few surviving matriarchal societies (isolated from society, now you know why). If you do notice, there is a slight smirk on Bela’s face … thats is where the story starts.</description>

It was a beautiful summer’s day and the ocean was placid…just right for a lazy day on the beach. Tsanto and her surfer friends were disappointed as the sea dozed and occasionally snorted. Teenage hormones and tame activities don’t go together! So they clowned around…made a couple of human pyramids on the sand and tossed the ball around from one towering team to the other.</description>

This was yet another trip for Dan to Delhi … the huge capital of India, it was all looking good. Camera in hand, some crisp dollars in his pocket-this was a great place to be in. Sophistication was in the air, atleast when he was visiting the forts and monuments around … eveyone spoke in accented English.</description>

For the uninitiated Barcamp is an unconference where all sorts of people come in for all sorts of reasons (freebies, free wifi included) . Those who are willing to present/speak on a topic simply add their names in the wiki and they are allocated a time slot to present.</description>

      <description>Lately desinerd.com has been under some tremendous bandwidth leeching from anonymous proxies. I am getting tired banning multiple IPs because they managed to eat up my monthly bandwidth quota in less than a week. Here are the public IPs which have hit me pretty hard
89.149.242.226 67.202.58.232 89.122.29.40 85.91.82.38 89.149.241.126 203.162.2.135
Time to use public IP ban lists, so that these leechers can’t attack me like this. All this has forced me to upgrade my setup and think a bit more about my content, so thanks to the guys who were using their brains so hard to pull my site down.</description>

In other news, i started using EC2 seriously and have found it to be an awesome service. My virtual machine was up for about 8 days before i finally pulled it down (bad choice it was as i ended up losing a lot of data).</description>

At any given point of time , my management(or lack of it) ;) invariably leads to wierd complexities (which obviously cannot be disclosed). So here goes list of things i want done asap Upgrade the wordpress, apparently the new admin GUI is uber-coool.

      <description>What is kwippy? - a micro/nanoblogging webapp + IM status logger + social network Why another microblogging app when there are already plenty out there? - There is twitter, pownce, jaiku, and 10 other similar ones. Though all of these promote small posts, each has a different kind of social network.
On twitter you mostly meet strangers. By strangers I mean people you don’t know in the real world. It’s like barcamp, or a conference where you go partly to network.</description>

The ideas are very much relevant in today’s businesses and will continue to be as long as the Gaussian bells are around. After some discussions with my friends i chanced upon this interesting idea that using the long tail model you can effectively change the consumer usage patterns, much like the Heisenberg principle in physics.</description>

      <description>Hmmm, unlike what most people have to say I have started to feel that Indians working in “outsourced” development teams are getting a real bad deal. In my recent experience, i have felt that in spite of all the big talk on how India has become costlier blah blah …. its my firm belief that there is very good quality of work being done here ….
So quality development work on cutting edge platforms is still termed as outsourcing, that was a rude shock to a guy like me :).</description>

      <description>So this post is devoted to my conception of a startup and the differences (or at least perceived ones) it has from a big firm. (Warning: These are very subjective differences) Startups are built for people who are ambitious and driven , thus this gives them the momentum going forward even if resources are scarce. From the above point it can be agreed easily that people who work at such places are to some extent different.</description>

URL uploads Bulk - basically copy a bunch of urls, which will be uploaded to slideshare Using plugins - We at slideshare have made two plugins (one for firefox another for IE) which will allow the user to upload into slideshare any online presentation they like with a single click.</description>

      <description>The web is currently obsessed with this concept of virality, how can a site grow exponentially in terms of traffic, user registrations and ten thousand other metrics. This reminds me of some sort of a gold rush, very little analysis behind what is right or wrong … people seem to be blinded by success and attempt to replicate it rather blindly.

The following changes have been made : After looking at techcruch’s 900px+ width, i have decided to increase the width of both the blogs for maximum space utilization.</description>

      <description>Here is some really cool stuff about google search. For a start let me introduce the concept of google subscribed link, think of it as an filter which allows you to share your content through the normal google search page. Its called a coop search because the user has to add this to his google search, if you send in bad content the user will stop using your specialized search .</description>

Checkout the Slideshare karaoke application built on top of the SlideShare API, a very cool tool which allows you to randomly pickup sideshows and have some really random fun ….
The API has been released some days back and hence the documentation is very sparse, but rest assured that with some more applications coming up there will be enough open source documentation around. This really cool piece of Javascript using the prototype library has been developed by Lalit patel , who is a specialist at JS and cross-browser issues.</description>
