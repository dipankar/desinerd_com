Do race to it, and if you are a startup in the Indian landscape and absolutely believe that you have something to share, then this is the platform you’ve been waiting for. Nominations for Proto.in Pune\nDate: July 25th, 2009Venue: Devang Mehta Auditorium, Persistent Systems, Pune\nWe are doing quite a few things new this time.\nProto.in Pune will be a one day Extravaganza. We are making Proto.in Pune as a one day event, but it goes on from 9am till 8pm in the evening. The day will be split into two moods. The first half of the day from 9am till 4:30pm will carry talks, sessions and interactive sessions especially aimed at educating, nurturing and supporting the startup landscape of India. There are prominent speakers such as the likes of Bharat Goenka of Tally, Pravin Gandhi of SeedFund, etc who will be talking during the event. Post 5pm, the event will take on a tone of the Oscars. 20 of the best startups - and we mean, absolutely, mindblowingly, best technology startups (includes biotech, healthcare, robotics etc), will take on the stage to deliver a world-class pitch to woo the audience with what they have been working on. Sounds exciting? Read on..\nThree Day Bootcamp. For the presenting companies of Proto.in Pune, there will be a three day bootcamp prepped. Day one will focus on diving into the business plan you have for the company, and combing through all the fine details. We are determined to ensure that your focus for the next one year of operations, clients and the market is set during this day. Day two, we teach you and groom you with everything that goes into the mastery of delivering a pitch. We will be bringing in some of the gurus of the advertising world, to make you create words that can sway the hardest of clients, and the toughest of journalists in buying into your story. Don’t forget to add the investors into that list. Day three, is all about the stage. We have had the priviledge of working with one of the country’s Best Event management company “BuzzWorks”. They, along with a team of stage directors will teach you how to handle yourself in front of the camera, what to do and what not to do when in a public forum - and these will help you make the most out of every speaking and forum opportunity you might get in the future - Starting with Proto.in\nWhat about those who dont make the Shortlist. We are a Startup Support platform remember? We get flooded with highly enthusiastic entrepreneurs every year, but apart from those who make it to the stage, what do we do for those who dont? Well, Every year, we ensure that we provide some feedback, especially to those who dont make it. This time and going forward, we want to ensure that we make it mandatory. All the folks who are helping us with the shortlisting are explicitly requested to spend more time with companies that arent quite there to ensure that they are helped in some way to help find the way. In our books, there are no bad companies - just companies that arent ready yet.\nAnd thats just half the story. We already have some nominations from companies that are in the medical space, companies working on hardcore engineering solutions, companies in the defense sector, and they are all lead to just one conclusion - Its going to be one hell of a rocking event, in Pune. You simply cant afford to not be part of it.\nThere is a team of delegates, including high network individuals, investors, and startups coming in from abroad as well. And this will be the moment to make your mark.\nThe question now is quite simple. Are you going to let it pass? I surely hope not. Then Why wait. Go ahead, Nominate!\nNote: Companies on being shortlisted for selection, have a Rs. 10,000 fee applicable. Nomination is free.\n","wordCount":"710","inLanguage":"en","datePublished":"2009-05-19T00:00:00Z","dateModified":"2009-05-19T00:00:00Z","author":{"@type":"Person","name":"Me"},"mainEntityOfPage":{"@type":"WebPage","@id":"https://www.desinerd.com/posts/nominations-for-proto-in-pune-are-open/"},"publisher":{"@type":"Organization","name":"Dipankar's blog","logo":{"@type":"ImageObject","url":"https://www.desinerd.com/%3Clink%20/%20abs%20url%3E"}}}</script></head><body id=top><script>localStorage.getItem("pref-theme")==="dark"?document.body.classList.add("dark"):localStorage.getItem("pref-theme")==="light"?document.body.classList.remove("dark"):window.matchMedia("(prefers-color-scheme: dark)").matches&&document.body.classList.add("dark")</script><header class=header><nav class=nav><div class=logo><a href=https://www.desinerd.com/ accesskey=h title="Home (Alt + H)"><img src=https://www.desinerd.com/apple-touch-icon.png alt aria-label=logo height=35>Home</a><div class=logo-switches><button id=theme-toggle accesskey=t title="(Alt + T)"><svg id="moon" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" width="24" height="18" viewBox="0 0 24 24" fill="none" stroke="currentcolor" stroke-width="2" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round"><path d="M21 12.79A9 9 0 1111.21 3 7 7 0 0021 12.79z"/></svg><svg id="sun" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" width="24" height="18" viewBox="0 0 24 24" fill="none" stroke="currentcolor" stroke-width="2" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round"><circle cx="12" cy="12" r="5"/><line x1="12" y1="1" x2="12" y2="3"/><line x1="12" y1="21" x2="12" y2="23"/><line x1="4.22" y1="4.22" x2="5.64" y2="5.64"/><line x1="18.36" y1="18.36" x2="19.78" y2="19.78"/><line x1="1" y1="12" x2="3" y2="12"/><line x1="21" y1="12" x2="23" y2="12"/><line x1="4.22" y1="19.78" x2="5.64" y2="18.36"/><line x1="18.36" y1="5.64" x2="19.78" y2="4.22"/></svg></button></div></div><ul id=menu><li><a href=https://www.desinerd.com/archives title=Archive><span>Archive</span></a></li><li><a href=https://www.desinerd.com/search/ title="Search (Alt + /)" accesskey=/><span>Search</span></a></li><li><a href=https://www.desinerd.com/tags/ title=Tags><span>Tags</span></a></li></ul></nav></header><main class=main><article class=post-single><header class=post-header><div class=breadcrumbs><a href=https://www.desinerd.com/>Home</a>&nbsp;»&nbsp;<a href=https://www.desinerd.com/posts/>Posts</a></div><h1 class=post-title>Nominations for Proto.in Pune, are Open!</h1><div class=post-meta><span title='2009-05-19 00:00:00 +0000 UTC'>May 19, 2009</span>&nbsp;·&nbsp;4 min&nbsp;·&nbsp;710 words&nbsp;·&nbsp;Me</div></header><div class=post-content><p>Amidst much excitement that is bubbling up at the Proto.in camp, we are happy to announce that the nominations for the upcoming edition are now open!
