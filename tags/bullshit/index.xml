      <description>One wonders how quickly time flies by ! Its pretty funny to realize that most of the times people are bull shitting other people [or worse, themselves]. The strength of the human mind seems to be its level of delusion, we all are fundamentally delusional. Some more than others.
One way of looking at it that you keep it all in check by anchoring your thoughts in reality. Well, the anchoring bit too is relative and a human at best.</description>
