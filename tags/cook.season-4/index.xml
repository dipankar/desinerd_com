      <description>So i just finished watching skins 04E07 and it was okay, me and Maitrayee were not looking forward to it as Skins to be honest has become super dark [beats dexter] and painful to watch. But surprise it was good and they threw in the google about Freddie at the end.
Effy Stonem is shown as a very dark character in this particular season, and with some help from herÂ counselor has managed to get Freddie killed !</description>
