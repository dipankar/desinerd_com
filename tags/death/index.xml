      <description>The death of a student sparked off violence in the IIT Kharagpur campus on Sunday as angry students damaged the residence of institute Director Damodar Acharya, demanding suspension of the superintendent of the institute-run hospital for alleged negligence.

      <description>The darwin awards - A Chronicle of Enterprising Demises
Came across this due to my good friend Mr. Samir … well it turns out that there is an award for people who do wierd stuff and end up seriously injured or dead. I salute the guy who is running this … who says there is no humor in death :). Honoring those who improve the species…by accidentally removing themselves from it!</description>
