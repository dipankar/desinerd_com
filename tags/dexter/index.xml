      <description>Been watching skins for quite some time and i must admit that this current season is a let down from before ! Even the fat segal’s inital tune is all mumbled up, not that cool anymore. Some very easy reasons as to why this is not working for me Most of the episodes are very very disconnected, the notion of time that was so seamless in the earlier 3 seasons is completely missing.</description>
