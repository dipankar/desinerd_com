      <description>Working on a very basic twitter background generator, right now focusing on how to get the sidebar width right. It is very much under use at my twitter handle @dipankarsarkar (http://twitter.com/dipankarsarkar). The core idea is to be abe to communicate more information about what i do as a person using the background image. Some features that I personally want are Transparency for the sidebar - The image underneath should be visible, right now its a grey opaque color.</description>

      <description>I was just having a look at some forums and saw some people talking about how to handle large parallel uploads. I have been having a look at this plugin which comes with NGINX and played around with it. Extremely useful if you use nginx in your stack and are getting killed by massive uploads.
Have fun!!
