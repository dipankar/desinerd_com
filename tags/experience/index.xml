      <description>I have been working on other peopleâ€™s bugs for the last couple of weeks and it has been a terribly painful experience. This has been a great experience which has taught me a lot of corrective measures for the roadmap ahead for me.

But what i saw is pure torture for a guy like me , you need some talent to write a decent application.</description>

The best part is that i finally get exposed to complete GUI based tools to do nearly everything, (i am sure i will find a way to do most things on the commadline). Well new things and seems i need to scale than the applications i work on ;).</description>
