      <description>As usual, formula 1 post the break becomes a bit more unpredictable. Its clear that some of the teams have got a whole bunch of new parts and seem to be making them work. Its interesting to see how McLaren has responded, and its clear that it will take the other frontrunners some more work to catch up with them. The exciting day ended with the following lineup for tomorrowâ€™s race @ Monza.</description>

      <description>So i finally paid for playing a fantasy league, been following F1 news quite closely. Very excited about the new teams and their approaches to car design. Nick Wirth is a rockstar who will define CFD to be the game changer in F1 for sure. I am a big supporter of such changes which can potentially make F1 budgets much lesser and who know maybe we can have the entry of much smaller teams in the future.</description>
