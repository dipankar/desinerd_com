      <description>I have been wondering how to write better things, and faster things. But more often than not I realize technology is nothing more than a tool to enable living things (like humans) perform more than their physical abilities (or extend the limitations).
The idea is to focus on the core ideas of human needs, which are fundamentally simple anyways. Not everything needs a google search and most of the Earthâ€™s population seems to survive without it.</description>
