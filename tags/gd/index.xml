      <description>So got to setting up OTRS, neat email based support system and it works pretty well it seems. There are some issues setting it up initially, but it integrates very well into your support email ! Should have thought of using it for kwippy once i think about it he he.

      <description>Well the simplest way of solving this is to run
sudo apt-get install php5-gd
That will install the necessary libraries that you need to keep continuing. If you are in windows then you need to go to your php.ini and uncomment the following lines
;extension=php_gd.dll ;extension=php_gd2.dll
[just remove the ; to uncomment them]
Hope that solves your image issues.</description>
