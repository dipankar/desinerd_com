      <description>Why one must ask is technology gendered ?
Are 1s and 0s, gendered !
Technology, if we look at only digital technology would count as one of crucial blocks of enabling all [of all colors, of all sizes] to take a pot shot at being successful [in various degrees]. It is hilarious to see how old school individuals who run our country want to empower every class by giving them subsidies [jobs, ration] and not fostering an environment where all can achieve self respect by working towards individual goals.</description>
