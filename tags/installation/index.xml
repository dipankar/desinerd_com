      <description>So here are some dead easy ways of getting munin and munin-node installed on your RHEL5 server.
First add RPM Forge repository rpm -Uhv http://apt.sw.be/redhat/el5/en/i386/rpmforge/RPMS/rpmforge-release-0.3.6-1.el5.rf.i386.rpm
Then just fire
yum install munin munin-node
Now, you have your munin running. Lets turn our attention to monit.
First add this new repo to you rpm -Uvh http://download.fedora.redhat.com/pub/epel/5/i386/epel-release-5-3.noarch.rpm
Then go ahead and install monit using yum install monit
Now this my friend was real easy !</description>

      <description>Today, after a long time I decided that my blog needed a revamp. Hope you guys like what I have tried with it. The goals at the start of this exercise were as follows: Neat looking template reflecting my minimalist style Good quality SEO, and clean permanent URLs (same as before) Move from the last host (as they are shutting down) Feel fresh and upgrade all the moving parts of the blog</description>
