      <description>Just created my first wordpress plugin, from concept to implementation in 3 hours :D. This plugin basically posts an update on kwippy when you publish a new blog post. This can be a good tutorial for someone trying to build their own plugins actually. Enjoy.

      <title>Nginx &#43; django fcgi lessons</title>

      <description>Today was a good day as i learned some valuable lessons about django and nginx. ALWAYS close the database cursor in django, it can lead to some pretty wierd memory issues going forward. FIND the most optimal number of database connections you initialize for you connection pooling. This will let you optimize on memory going forward. ENSURE that you do not set a very high client_timeout, this means that if connections are not explicitly not closed by the client then the web server will not timeout.</description>

      <title>Pownce gone, use kwippy</title>
      <link>https://www.desinerd.com/posts/pownce-gone-use-kwippy/</link>

      <description>In a blatant act of self promotion, now that pownce is finished, I can confidently write that we are the only other django based micro-blogging network with some traction. I do admit the user interface needs a bit of work, but if you interact with our community, you will realize that they are a set of amazing people.
So keeping in mind that you want to move on from pownce, try something new … or just try kwippy.</description>

      <title>httpfuse : best way to aggregate links</title>
      <link>https://www.desinerd.com/posts/httpfuse-best-way-to-aggregate-links/</link>

      <guid>https://www.desinerd.com/posts/httpfuse-best-way-to-aggregate-links/</guid>
      <description>Httpfuse is a very simple concept which allows collaborative link aggregation. The strength lies in the fact that a significant part of the functionality is developed and it is well populated with data. I have displayed one of the fuses i developed over at httpfuse, does it not look great. I have worked upon the data collection actually well it has 4 million odd links beat that :D. Its probably one of the very few Indian sites to have this amounts of data in its system to be honest.</description>

      <description>Kwippy has fireeagle integration now :D …. and all done in 2 days flat. The API is not that stable to be honest, but has the potential for greatness.
The kwippy integration basically has a small signup application that is independent of the main app, there is a signup page which integrates and then the rest is in the parent application. I should be posting a picture here, but too lazy he he ….</description>
