      <description>Well, working on freeBSD right now some immediate learnings for most linux users Ports is as good as apt-get [and i would say much better, when i started installing stuff] You will need to start with installing vim and bash to make your life a lot easier
So the target was to install python and nginx, both of which are very easy to install once you understand how the whole ports collection system works.</description>

      <description>I know it would be simple for a lot of people reading this blog :). But the easiest way to remote desktop into a windows machine using a X based linux distro is to install rdesktop.
http://www.rdesktop.org
For ubuntu and debian based distro, fire up the console and type
sudo apt-get install rdesktop
This would install the client.
rdesktop &amp;lt;server IP/domain&amp;gt;
This would fire up the windows remote desktop stuff.</description>
