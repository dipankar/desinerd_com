      <description>I have been using the micro-framework called bottle.py, and starting to write fairly complicated applications on top of it. So I have been able to put together a relatively clean structure based that serves my maintainability issues
This setup uses redis, memcached, and mako as the templating language. Lets assume the application name is project.
project/project/main.py - This is the core application file that loads up bottle and the pluginsproject/INSTALL - This is the readme and simple installation instructionsproject/middlewares.</description>

      <description>When you are using a platform like django you realise how slow sessions can get when you are using the database as a backend. The problem of using a memory cache like memcached is the fact that when you restart the server to refresh the cache or remove stale objects, the problem is that you lose your sessions data and a lot of people using your site get logged out. The only solution to this problem is to use 2 memcached instances , one for your regular python objects and another for your sessions objects â€¦ this is not a default feature in Django.</description>
