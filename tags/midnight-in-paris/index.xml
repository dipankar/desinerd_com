      <description>Just finished watching a fantastic Woody Allen movie “midnight in paris&amp;quot; , it is very clear that he still knows his shit! I was not expecting a lot from the movie, but ended up enjoying it with quite a few loud laughs thrown in. You had Owen Wilson, who was his usual calm self throughout and the rest really did a great job as well. The story line is about how people keep thinking the past was a better fit for them, and well it looks like people in the past also kept thinking the same.</description>
