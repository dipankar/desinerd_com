      <description>One of the first things that i wanted to implement in my university [~2006] was a operating system with only the Firefox browser as the core application. Turns out that is a popular reality now with the Chromebook and well to some extent the Firefox OS which is being released. I at that point had no idea that mobile would become that big, with the exposure that I had. Its all coming together!</description>

      <title>Technology driven MPD : Karthik calling karthik</title>

      <description>So i watched this interesting hindi movie today Karthik calling karthik, which should also be be called the watered down Indian version of the cult book &amp;amp; movie ‘Fight club’. [Stop here if you don’t want to know what the movie is]
Unlike say fight club where i would say that the plot was beyond most of us ! This movie tries to explain itself too much and loses out on what could have been too easily.</description>

      <description>I am starting from nothing, very little tweeting @dipankarsarkar , and hardly any blog posts here. So 1st December is an attempt at reviving my non-existent web presence. So what keeps me so busy from even writing a simple blog post, i will try to summarize that over the next points Sometime a year back i realized that family was important :), so yes i definitely spend a lot more time with my family.</description>
