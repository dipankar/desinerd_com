      <description>I am looking forward to attending proto @ blore, there are a lot of reasons to do so. Great set of people, will get to meet the very best entrepreneurs in India. In addition, to understanding the challenges people are trying to solve. Shotgun Startup - amazing concept and i really want to be a part of it. The feeling of implementing something in a very short time is exhilarating to say the least.</description>
