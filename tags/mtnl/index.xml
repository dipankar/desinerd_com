      <description>Mine is a dual connection household, I use one Airtel connection as the primary and the secondary MTNL one for backup. However, it seems I will need to change the order of those soon. Lately, airtel seems to have very odd bandwidth counters which always seem to never match up with my router connection monthly counters. The difference is more than 20-30% month on month [adding both up and down counters!</description>
