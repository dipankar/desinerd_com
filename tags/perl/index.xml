      <description>I encountered some interesting issues when pulling out CSV from my MySQL databases. The core issue was the csv generated was not seemingly compatible with the various spreadsheet readers in Windows. After having a closer look at the file, it turns out to be an encoding issue clearly.
As the database was Latin1 encoded, the carriage return was handled as r [shows up as ^M on VI]Â in some text blobs.</description>
