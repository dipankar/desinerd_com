      <description>Easiest way to get php with good looking urls running on your site . Works for drupal, wordpress and joomla.
server { listen 80; server_name www.domain.com; index index.html index.htm index.php; root /path/to/domain/files; location / { error_page 404 = //e/index.php?q=$uri; } location ~ .php$ { include fastcgi_params; fastcgi_pass 127.0.0.1:9000; fastcgi_index index.php; fastcgi_param SCRIPT_FILENAME /path/to/domain/files$fastcgi_script_name; } access_log /usr/local/nginx/logs/domain.access_log; error_log /usr/local/nginx/logs/domain.error_log; }</description>
