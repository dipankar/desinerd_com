      <description>Well the simplest way of solving this is to run
sudo apt-get install php5-gd
That will install the necessary libraries that you need to keep continuing. If you are in windows then you need to go to your php.ini and uncomment the following lines
;extension=php_gd.dll ;extension=php_gd2.dll
[just remove the ; to uncomment them]
Hope that solves your image issues.</description>
