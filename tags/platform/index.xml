      <description>I have been working on other people’s bugs for the last couple of weeks and it has been a terribly painful experience. This has been a great experience which has taught me a lot of corrective measures for the roadmap ahead for me. Some basic observations are Not everyone can program or should program - Conceptually it is really easy to type in read a tutorial or 2. But what i saw is pure torture for a guy like me , you need some talent to write a decent application.</description>

      <description>Well, for lack of better topics i will take this opportunity to talk about some cool things that i have started to learn namely the .NET platform. The best part is that i finally get exposed to complete GUI based tools to do nearly everything, (i am sure i will find a way to do most things on the commadline). Well new things and seems i need to scale than the applications i work on ;).</description>

      <description>In my experience with both rails and django, i would have to admit that a lot of things need to be improved at the core of these platforms so that developers can truly deploy a really fast production site. Let talk about what we did at kwippy to make it that much more faster than the default Django setup. Use memcached properly : The trick in getting speed is to cache all logged out pages and heavy caching of the user objects when logged in.</description>
