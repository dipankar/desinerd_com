      <description>I have been wondering how to write better things, and faster things. But more often than not I realize technology is nothing more than a tool to enable living things (like humans) perform more than their physical abilities (or extend the limitations).
The idea is to focus on the core ideas of human needs, which are fundamentally simple anyways. Not everything needs a google search and most of the Earth’s population seems to survive without it.</description>

      <description>Well, my name is Dipankar Sarkar. And Sarkar is hindi for goverment … so one my friends (specifically Varun Gulshan) would keep calling me that which to be honest is a fantastic nickname ;). Jokes apart, I guess i am a bit frustrated with how things work around me. As an individual who says “chop, chop” as he is in a perennial hurry, it kills me to see how things work.</description>
