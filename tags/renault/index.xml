      <description>I realise that i am an extremely obsessive person ! So i ended up following formula 1 [the drama that it has become] over the last 2 months. A small recap for the uninitiated End of last season saw the exit of many engine manufacturers namely Toyota, BMW, &amp;amp; nearly Renault. So the engines on the grid are Ferrari, Mercedes, Cosworth[due to the new teams] &amp;amp; Renault. It would count as a huge loss, as most of the engines have very similar specs, though certain other things like reliability &amp;amp; fuel consumption are still going to be the game changers.</description>
