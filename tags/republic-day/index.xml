      <description>I was having this debate how nationalism in India is on the wane, a whole bunch of people talk about how their houses used to have the Indian flag hoisted on independence day/Republic day. Not anymore through. Its not difficult to see why and how the country is changing.
I do hope we understand the point of sticking it out together as a nation, and possibly be one of the greatest ever in this phase of human civilization.</description>
