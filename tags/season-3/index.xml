      <description>Well, chuck with his flashing is good fun â€¦ but his kung fu is not funny. I was okay with flashing about intelligence, but all this new flashing shit is irritating !
This episode revolved around the much in the background John Casey [good man blah blah] who at the end is relegated to civilian life [how tragic]. It finally goes into the machine he is, his patriotism and all that which we all already knew about.</description>
