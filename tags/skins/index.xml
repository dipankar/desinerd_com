      <description>So i just finished watching skins 04E07 and it was okay, me and Maitrayee were not looking forward to it as Skins to be honest has become super dark [beats dexter] and painful to watch. But surprise it was good and they threw in the google about Freddie at the end.
Effy Stonem is shown as a very dark character in this particular season, and with some help from her counselor has managed to get Freddie killed !</description>

      <description>Been watching skins for quite some time and i must admit that this current season is a let down from before ! Even the fat segal’s inital tune is all mumbled up, not that cool anymore. Some very easy reasons as to why this is not working for me Most of the episodes are very very disconnected, the notion of time that was so seamless in the earlier 3 seasons is completely missing.</description>
