      <description>Well due to one of my best friends i have got rather addicted to GITS :) or “The ghost in the shell”, an awesome japanese anime series. There is a concept or rather a case of the laughing man, and the basis for that is a JD Salinger short story of the same name. I take this post to link up to that story, hope you all have a great week ahead.</description>

(CNN) – Researchers have produced aerial photos of jungle dwellers who they say are among the few remaining peoples on Earth who have had no contact with the outside world.
A very random story on this picture, njoi
Vellan and Tipsy were sitting, happily looking at Bela their ummm hot wife, well this is one of the few surviving matriarchal societies (isolated from society, now you know why). If you do notice, there is a slight smirk on Bela’s face … thats is where the story starts.</description>
