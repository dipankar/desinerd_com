      <description>GREEN Olympiad is an international environment quiz programme which targets school students from classes 8th to 10th. The idea is to inculcate a sense of responsibility for mother Earth among the future citizens of India.
Students need to enroll through their respective schools. The state, country and global winners are awarded exclusive prizes. Each and every participant also gets a certificate of participation from Ministry of Environment and Forests.
GREEN Olympiad also culminates into a 13 episode programme called the TERRAQUIZ which is televised every year.</description>
