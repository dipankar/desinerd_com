      <title>Going from WordPress multisite to regular wordpress</title>

      <description>We had a wordpress multi-site installation that was working just fine! However custom domain and SSL pose a clear problem, along with any specific changes one might have to make to the installation.
NO CODE! NO SQL!
So I decided to move back to regular wordpress. Now we are using the popular exponent theme, the challenge is that we are using a default demo setup which is modified. The goal was to make an easy shift, not make it into a week long project ;).</description>

      <title>GD Library Error: Imagecreatetruecolor Does Not Exist</title>

      <description>Well the simplest way of solving this is to run
sudo apt-get install php5-gd
That will install the necessary libraries that you need to keep continuing. If you are in windows then you need to go to your php.ini and uncomment the following lines
;extension=php_gd.dll ;extension=php_gd2.dll
[just remove the ; to uncomment them]
Hope that solves your image issues.</description>

      <title>Listing all your blogposts</title>

      <description>So here is a quick snapshot at how to get all your wordpress blogposts using python [or wordpresslib to be specific]
– #!/usr/bin/env python import wordpresslib import tinyurl wordpress = raw_input(&amp;lsquo;&amp;lsquo;Wordpress URL:&amp;rsquo;&amp;rsquo;) user = raw_input(&amp;lsquo;&amp;lsquo;Username:&amp;rsquo;&amp;rsquo;) password = raw_input(&amp;lsquo;&amp;lsquo;Password:&amp;rsquo;&amp;rsquo;)
prepare client object wp = wordpresslib.WordPressClient(wordpress, user, password)
select blog id wp.selectBlog(0) posts = wp.getRecentPosts(100) for p in posts: if p.title.find(&amp;ldquo;p=&amp;rdquo;)&amp;lt;0: print p.title,&amp;quot; - &amp;ldquo;,tinyurl.create_one(p.link) – Now that is real easy to use IMHO, i just started using this in one of my scripts.</description>

      <description>Today, after a long time I decided that my blog needed a revamp. Hope you guys like what I have tried with it. The goals at the start of this exercise were as follows: Neat looking template reflecting my minimalist style Good quality SEO, and clean permanent URLs (same as before) Move from the last host (as they are shutting down) Feel fresh and upgrade all the moving parts of the blog</description>

      <description>Just created my first wordpress plugin, from concept to implementation in 3 hours :D. This plugin basically posts an update on kwippy when you publish a new blog post. This can be a good tutorial for someone trying to build their own plugins actually. Enjoy.
